# Jupyter Notebook files

You can create content with Jupyter notebooks.
For example, the content for the current page is contained in {download}`this notebook file <./notebooks.ipynb>`.

```{margin}
If you'd like to write in plain-text files, but still keep a notebook structure, you can write
Jupyter notebooks with MyST Markdown, which are then automatically converted to notebooks.
See [](./myst-notebooks.md) for more details.
```

Jupyter Book supports all Markdown that is supported by Jupyter Notebook.
This is mostly a flavour of Markdown called [CommonMark Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) with minor modifications.
For more information about writing Jupyter-flavoured Markdown in Jupyter Book, see [](./markdown.md).

## Code blocks and image outputs

Jupyter Book will also embed your code blocks and output in your book.
For example, here's some sample Matplotlib code:
